    This is what happens when you burn garbage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.
    <br/>
    While you are walking and you finished a drink, don't throw it to the street! If you can close it, close it, and then put it in a bag, nearby garbage, or in your jacket! I would think that this
    <br/>
    will work because the germs from the drink does not go down the drain.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2.
    <br/>
    If you are in your car, and you have some garbage, better not to throw it out the window, keep it in your car until you are home. Sometimes people dump their drinks out their window!
    <br/>
    Many people throw their drink out of their window because not only they don't care, but also they're lazy, mad, stressed, or do not like the drink.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3.
    <br/>
    Maybe this is rare but it could happen, burning garbage. That is a bad thing that could happen because the fumes from the burned garbage can go to the air, or into someones body. If you have
    <br/>
    If you do have trash in your house and you like burning things, don't burn garbage because the smoke can cause asthma attacks, health problems and accidental fires.

    <h1> About StormWater </h1>
    <h2> What does Stormwater do to the world? </h2>
    <h4> Storm Water is a problem to the world, because water that comes from the rain, drops down
      <br/>
    then carries polution which cause storm waterpolution. </h4>
      <br/>
      <img src="http://www.miwaterstewardship.org/Portals/0/images/water-oil.stormdrain.322px.jpg">
      <br/>
      <caption> Effect on stormwater polution. </caption>
      <br/>
      <h4> The stormwater can effect the world because when the polution goes down the drain, it
      <br/>
      will go to the ocean, (if the waste water treatment plant is full) then the sea animals will get infected by the pollution.
      <br/>
      Now sometimes when you eat fish, it could be infected by the pollution. This doesn't mean you can't eat sea food.
      <br/>
      Every year a tons of fish die of pollution and it is caused by us humans who litter. Don't litter when you are lazy,
      <br/>
      If we have people in our world that don't litter, just imagine how life would be! Clean fish, clean ocean, and less chance of global warming.
      <br/>
      Just think about the extintict animals and plants, all because of our garbage (and also killing) had lead to many extintictions of animals.
      <br/>
      Even if we had LAWS, littering will still be a thing because even if you break the law of littering and you have to pay, people are gonna
      <br/>
      litter because people are going to do it when no one is looking at them. Maybe some countries don't have laws about littering. That's why our
      <br/>
      world has many things extintict because of our garbage. We can stop this by putting more garbage cans so that people can put it in the garbage
      <br/>
      easily. If you are manager of the city, what would you do when there is a garbage problem?
