    <div><h3> Since all of this stormwater pollution is happening, we have to change and make a difference. How are we going to do that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1st way: Be responsible.
    <br/>
    We can do that by keeping the garbage we have with us while we are walking and not throw it to the street because that can cause
    stormwater pollution which is the problem to our world. Then dispose of the trash properly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2nd way: Be careful when you have garbage.
    <br/>
    When you have accidentaly left the garbage on the drive way and you need to go somewhere. So you get in your car, and drive out the drive way
    but at the same time, you ran over the garbage and you don't notice. That's not being careful. What is being careful is not being lazy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3rd way: Think twice.
    <br/>
    When you really hate this one drink and you don't want in your car, don't throw it out the window. If you do, that's not thinking twice.
    What is thinking twice is not throwing it by understanding you can bring it home and try to make it better.
    <br/>
    These are some of my suggestions people should do.
