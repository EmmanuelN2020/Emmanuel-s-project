    <h2> What does Stormwater do to the world? </h2>
    <h3> Storm Water is a problem to the world, because water that comes from the rain, drops down
      <br/>
      then carries polution which cause storm waterpolution. </h3>

      <h4> Effect on stormwater polution. </h4>
      <br/>
      <div><h3>
       The stormwater can affect the world because when the polution goes down the drain, it
      will go to the ocean. If the waste water treatment plant is full then the sea animals will be affected by the pollution.

      Sometimes when you eat fish, it could be infected by the pollution. This doesn't mean you can't eat sea food.

      Every year a ton of fish die of pollution and it is caused by humans who litter. Don't litter.

      If we have people in our world that don't litter, just imagine how life would be! Clean fish, clean ocean, and less chance of global warming.
      <br/>
      Just think about the extintict animals and plants, all because of our garbage has lead to many extintictions of animals. <!--SOURCE THIS-->

      Even if we had laws, littering will still be a thing because even if you break the law of littering and you have to pay, people are going to

      litter when no one is looking at them. Maybe some countries don't have laws about littering. That's why our

      world has many things extintict because of our garbage. We can stop this by putting more garbage cans so that people can put trash in the garbage easily. If you are manager of the city, what would you do when there is a garbage problem?
